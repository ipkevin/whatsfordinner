Made in 5 hours for the BrainStation Web Dev bootcamp's first group hackathon.  Along with 2 other developers, we designed & built this What's For Dinner website in a single morning in February 2023.

Enter an ingredient and get back recipes along with Youtube videos and photos.

Built in React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, plus using the Knex.js library to make API calls to a 3rd party database for recipe information. 

## How to Use
* Clone repo to your local folder
* npm -i to install dependencies
* npm start to run
